# SDM Object Linking

When building DataMiner solutions, you often need to create relationships between different objects (such as elements, services, or custom data types). This library provides a standard way to create, manage, and query those links.

It comes with:
- A C# library for linking objects in your DataMiner solution
- Helper classes and models to simplify automation and integration scenarios

## How to use

The entry point for the library is the **ObjectLinker**. You can use it to create and query links between objects.

### Getting the linker

```csharp
// Getting the object linker

// Automation Scripts -> nuget Skyline.DataMiner.SDM.ObjectLinking.Automation
var linker = engine.GetObjectLinker();

// Connectors -> nuget Skyline.DataMiner.SDM.ObjectLinking.Protocol
var linker = protocol.GetObjectLinker();

// GQI -> nuget Skyline.DataMiner.SDM.ObjectLinking.GQI
var linker = args.DMS.GetObjectLinker(); // In the OnInit life cycle method

// Other -> nuget Skyline.DataMiner.SDM.ObjectLinking.Common
var linker = connection.GetObjectLinker();
```

### Creating links

```csharp
// Creating a link between 2 entities.
var entity1 = new EntityDescriptor
{
	ID = "entity1",
	DisplayName = "Entity 1",
	ModelName = "Model A",
	SolutionName = "Solution X",
	ParentID = "parent1",
	ParentModelName = "Parent Model A",
};
var entity2 = new EntityDescriptor
{
	ID = "entity2",
	DisplayName = "Entity 2",
	ModelName = "Model B",
	SolutionName = "Solution Y",
	ParentID = "parent2",
	ParentModelName = "Parent Model B",
};

linker.Create(entity1, entity2);
```

### Querying links

```csharp
// Querying links between entities.
var entityId = "entity1";
var linkedEntities = linker.GetLinkedEntities(entityId);

// Custom filters
var filter = LinkExposers.EntityDescriptors.SolutionName.Equal("Solution X");
var linkedEntitiesWithFilter = linker.Links.Read(filter);
```
