# SDM Object Linking

This solution provides a standardized way to create, manage, and query relationships between objects in your DataMiner environment. It comes with:

- A C# library for linking objects (such as elements, services, or custom data types) in your DataMiner solution
- Helper classes and models to simplify automation and integration scenarios

## Use Cases

Centralized object linking enables a wide range of scenarios, including:
- **Relationship Mapping**: Manage how different entities (elements, services, etc.) are related within your DataMiner system.
- **Impact Analysis**: Quickly identify which objects are affected when a specific entity changes or is removed.
- **Automated Workflows**: Build automation scripts that traverse or manipulate linked objects for advanced orchestration.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure that references between objects remain valid and up-to-date across your solution.
- **Custom Integrations**: Enable third-party tools or custom apps to query and leverage object relationships programmatically.

## How to use

For detailed instructions on integrating the object linking library with your DataMiner solutions, see the [Documentation](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-SDM-ObjectLinking/tree/main/docs).
